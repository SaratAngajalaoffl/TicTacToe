# TicTacToe

## The game has been implemented using the following algorithms and you can also check the time each algorithm takes to compute a move in the console.

###		Basic Minimax

###		Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

###		Minimax with Depth-Limit

###		Minimax with both alpha-beta pruning and Depth-Limit

###		Minimax using all the above algorithms together and some optimisation for current situation.
